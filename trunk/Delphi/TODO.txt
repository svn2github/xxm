general

- central version resource(s)

- XxmProjectUnload

- LastModified: use bias! (an hour less than IIS?)

- Context.URLPath
- Context.Priority (linked to thread priority!)
- set-cookie2 support
- context: settings from registry (e.g. connectionstring?)
- registration editor
- response timeout (how to halt a running thread?)
- document.browser
- content buffers: huge page support (Vista+)

- some good solution for common xxm.pas and xxmFReg.pas units

- logging

- XMLHTTP starts new session: test with authentication! (take-over other SessionID?)

Conv
- increment build version? (how to edit .res?)
- revise 'entry', directory or xxmp required
- flags
- signature on proto files?
- default proto in resources?
- '_proto' per directory even?
- whitespace before [[ into source, not output?
- create new project (can't get ShellNew to work!)
- CreateProcessWithLogin for compile?
- web.xxmp signature in TWebProject (not TProjectCacheEntry)
- dynamic list of supported exceptions, default pas,xxm,xxmi (act; proto, unit, res?)

ISAPI
- keep-connection?
- custom errors?
- compile-time user (runas)
- IP(range) to show compile log to

http
- logging
- FCookie WideString
- handling long uploads in group-thread like XxmSpoolingConnections

local
- CritSection in loader, not context (saves on resources)
- error/builderror response codes from registry (default 500?)
- if xxl in same dir, reg and run
- store to cache file
- history by xxm project

grand rework
- content-encoding gzip, other?
- Accept-Ranges: bytes on files ('Range' request header?)
- IPv6 support? http://[::]/

idea's
- find something better than a threadvar for the session data object reference
- limit threads per session
- limit threads per remote address
- TXxmProjectEntry.GetFilePath virtual directories

minor issues
- xxm.pas: version from resource?
